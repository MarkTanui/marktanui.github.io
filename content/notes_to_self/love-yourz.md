### Dear friend,

As I write this, I'm listening to [J.Cole's love yourz](https://open.spotify.com/track/2e3Ea0o24lReQFR4FA7yXH?si=3d9155e8fdcf4577). One of my favorite songs from him, coz there's no such thing like a life that's better than yourz. And definitely no life is better than mine. (Three seconds of affirmation there)

Time flies, and here we are. Living life. Some have figured it out, and that's in order. Some, still trying to. Trying to find some meaning, some way foward, some G(g)od to save them. Well, that has always been our fate. To try. To get. To lose. To suffer. To love. To Hope.

But apparently, that's not the reason I write this. I want us, me and you, to reintroduced ourselves. My friend, where did we meet? When did we meet? How did we get it rolling?


#### Let me reintroduce myself.

As I reintroduced myself, let me make it clear that I have not changed my name(s) and neither have I my pronouns. The much is probably a nickname, which is in the signage of my letter to you.

Probably we met 10+ years ago, maybe a year ago, some months ago, today morning or we are yet to meet.  If we met 10+ years ago, you and I are super humans. It doesn't last that long, you know. A year or months ago, can we be super humans together? yes, ofcourse. That's why we need to reintroduce ourselves. Yet to meet? please let us get it rolling.

Here it is: I have not changed. I have grown, I've learned, I've adapted and I've found things to die and others to live for. My music taste is different, my fashion --if I had/have any-- is not the same. The books I read, the food I prefer to eat, the drinks I enjoy, the guilty pleasures: everything is not as you left it.

Therefore, don't use the "you've changed" line to avoid conversations with this version of Tanui. We're still friends, if we were. You can be a  friend, with this version of me. I'm loving mine and so should you.

And yes, I've changed and so have you. It hasn't stopped yet, it never does.

#### Now, reintroduce yourself.

What about you? I'm really intrested to know. Have you picked up poetry, art, a new career, or are you making your relationship with God better?

Reintroduce yourself and let me love yourz. The yourz that is and will be.

How is school? What's that inside you that has been different? What are those thoughts and emotions you've been having lately? Dear friend, let us reintroduced ourselves and love ourz.



yourz,
