## [Day 6] 
`Email Analysis` It's beginning to look a lot like phishing

*On the sixth day of Christmas:  I do an email analysis -both static & dynamic*

Task 6: Help McSkidy to get more clues on what happened by analysing a phishing email.

### Email Analysis
I had previously done an article on [phishing email analysis](https://hackmd.io/@themadbit/rJL3OeM8s) which has close to the same content provided in Advent of Cyber.

However, I've found useful tools and methodologies that I'll write below. 

1. emlAnalyzer - CLI tool to automate header analysis and attachment extraction.
2. https://emailrep.io/ - site that gives email reputation.
3. https://labs.inquest.net/ - site for file/hash/domain reputation.
4. IPinfo.io - A service that provides detailed information about an IP address by focusing on geolocation data and service provider.
5. Talos Reputation - An IP reputation check service is provided by Cisco Talos.
6. Urlscan.io - A service that analyses websites by simulating regular user behaviour.
7. Browserling - A browser sandbox is used to test suspicious/malicious links.
8. Wannabrowser - A browser sandbox is used to test suspicious/malicious links.
9. https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload - Virus Total for hash-based file reputation analysis.
