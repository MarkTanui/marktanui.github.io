## AoC [Day 1]
```Frameworks```: Someone's coming to town!

*On the first day of christmas: I met McSkidy*

In this year's AoC, I help the elf McSkidy to investigate a serious breach and test all remaining systems for security flaws.
I look forward to a **fun Christmas story**.

**Task 1** - `I help McSkidy to uncover the attackers by solving a puzzle left behind by the actors.` 
The Security Frameworks come in handy in this.

### Security Frameworks
Security frameworks are designed to guide in setting up security programs and improve the security posture of the organisation.

Security frameworks are documented processes that define policies and procedures organisations should follow to establish and manage security controls. They are guiding pillars for identifying and managing the risks organizatons may face and the weaknesses in place that may lead to an attack.

Some of the commonly used frameworks include:

#### 1. NIST Cybersecurity Framework

This security Framework is developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and it provides detailed guidance for organisations to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. The framework focuses on five essential functions: `Identify` -> `Protect` -> `Detect` -> `Respond` -> `Recover`. 

#### 2. ISO 27000 Series

These series of standards provides best practice recommendations on information security management—the management of information risks through information security controls.

#### 3. MITRE ATT&CK Framework
Also commonly known as Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). The framework’s structure is similar to a periodic table, mapping techniques against phases of the attack chain and referencing system platforms exploited. This way, security teams can identify attack patterns and mitigate.

#### 4. Cyber Kill Chain.

The model identifies what the adversaries must complete in order to achieve their objective. In turn, this framework is helps defense teams to form intelligence which they use in identification and prevention of cyber intrusions activity.

The kill chain comprises of these seven phases/stages: `reconnaissance`, `weaponization`, `delivery`, `exploitation`, `installation`, `command and control` (C2), and `actions on objectives`.

#### 5. Unified Kill Chain.

The Unified Kill Chain can be described as the unification of the MITRE ATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain frameworks. Published by Paul Pols in 2017 (and reviewed in 2022), the UKC provides a model to defend against cyber attacks from the adversary’s perspective. The UKC offers security teams a blueprint for analysing and comparing threat intelligence concerning the adversarial mode of working.
